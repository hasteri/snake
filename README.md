# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

Following modifications / additions are made to the SnakeGame project:

* User Input
  * The project accepts user input regarding the wished difficulty of the game. It can either be "beginner", "intermediate" or "advanced". The difference is the increasing speed.
* Added a new abstract Class "GameObject". It contains a vector of threads that can be used from the classes Game and Snake for their threads (see below Multithreading) and some virtual functions to start these threads.
  * These virtual functions are marked with override by the inherited classes Game and Snake.
* Defined template for the functions Add and Delete snake cells in the SnakeQueue.
  * These functions are defined using move semantics.
* Destructors are used appropriately and they output a stream when the program ends.
* Smart pointers are used in this project -> for the queue of Snake Cells.
* Added Multithreading: There are three function threads running in the project: Snake::Update, Game::Update and Game::PlaceFood.
  * Mutexes, locks and condition variables are used in each of these functions.
  * These three threads are terminated in the abstract class "GameObject" in the destructor.

* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)
